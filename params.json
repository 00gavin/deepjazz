It uses [Keras](http://keras.io/) & [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), two deep learning libraries, to generate jazz music. It uses the AI technology that powers [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/alpha-go.html) and [Google DeepDream](http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html) to make music, something that's often considered as deeply human.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nJi-Sung Kim  \r\nPrinceton University, Department of Computer Science  \r\njisungk@princeton.edu  \r\n\r\n### License\r\nApache License 2.0",
