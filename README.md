### Using Keras & Theano for deep learning driven jazz generation
I built this project for the "HackPrinceton, Spring 2016" event. It uses Keras & Theano, two deep learning libraries, to generate jazz music. It uses the AI technology that powers AlphaGo and Google DeepDream to make music, something that's often considered as deeply human.
